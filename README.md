# Tweet_Location_Classification
This project involves the use a Naive Bayes Classifier to find patterns in real tweets. There are three files: new_york.json, london.json, and paris.json. These three files contain tweets that are gathered from those locations.

The goal is to use natural language processing techniques and create a classification algorithm that can classify any tweet (or sentence) and predict whether that tweet came from New York, London, or Paris. The classification algorithm that was chosen was the Naive Bayes Classifier which has an accuracy score of 72.25%
